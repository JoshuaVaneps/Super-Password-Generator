# Super-Password-Generator
## Description
I modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Usage
When you click the button to generate a password you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. You can then select which criteria to include.  When prompted for length of the password you can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. When asked for character types to include in the password you must confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  When each prompt is answered the password is generated and displayed written on the page.
